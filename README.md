# LinkedList
A very lightweight implementation of a doubly linked-list, useful only for projects like arduino programming, where including the standard library is impractical.

The title comments of List.hpp and ListIterator.hpp contain everything you need to know to use this list.

Partly based on code by brvboas (Jason Schwarzenberger) at https://github.com/brvboas/doubly-linked-list
